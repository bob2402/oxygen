<h2>Merits</h2>
<p>
  Merits are how we represent the relative value of everyone's contribution to a
  Rocket.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  Merits are only ever produced in response to work done - solving a problem.

  subtitle=" If we compare Nostrocket to a legacy Company, Merit holders are something akin
to board members. However, while board members actively control the direction
of a company, the role of Merit holders is very simple: the only thing they
need to do is vote to approve or reject requests for Merits in response to
solved problems. The direction of a Rocket is an emergent property of this process."
